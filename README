🌟 Islamic Poems Collection Web App 🌟
I developed a web app to gather and showcase the Islamic poems (Naaths and Manqabat) of Hazrat Allama Maulana Hafiz o Qari Alhaj Ash-Shah Muhammed Qalandar Razvi Sahab Qibla, Raichur's. The app offers a clean, easy-to-navigate interface for exploring various categories of poems, providing a seamless reading experience.

Key Features:

📜 Collection of Naaths and Manqabat: A categorized collection of Islamic poetry
🌐 Multi-language Support: Poems are available in both English and Urdu.
🔍 Search Functionality: Easily search for specific poems by title or category.
💬 Feedback Page: Users can report mistakes or suggest additions to improve the collection.
🎨 Responsive Design: The app is fully responsive, ensuring a smooth experience on both desktop and mobile devices.
Built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, this app reflects a dedication to preserving Islamic literature and making it accessible to a broader audience.
